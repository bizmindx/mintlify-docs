description: "This guide helps you set up your Keringit account, build your first project, and launch it on-chain. Whether you're using AI to build from scratch or uploading an existing repo, follow these steps to get started quickly"
---

## 1. Create Your Keringit Account

### Sign Up or Connect Wallet

- You can create an account using **email and password**, or
- **Connect your wallet** _(MetaMask or WalletConnect supported)_.
- Wallet connection also enables direct onchain deployments later

### Set Up Your Profile

- Set up your profile _(can be changed later)_.
- You can customize notifications and toggle between dark/light mode in settings

### Access Your Dashboard

- After logging in, you’ll land on the **Keringit dashboard**
- Here you can:
  - Create new projects
  - View or edit your existing builds
  - Monitor deployments, templates, and AI drafts

## 2. Start a New Project

### Option A: Use a Template

- Go to **Templates** from the sidebar
- Choose from pre-built dApp templates (e.g., NFT launchpads, staking apps, token contracts)
- You can begin customizing instantly.

### Option B: Build with AI

- Head to **AI Builder**
- Type what you want to build in plain English:

  > Example: "Write a smart contract for a token XYZ with 2% tax on buys."
- Keringit will auto-generate:
  - Smart contracts
  - Frontend UI
  - Recommended testnet setup

### Option C: Import Code

- Upload your files manually or sync from GitHub
- Supported:
  - Solidity contracts
  - Frontend files
  - ABIs and environment configs

## 3. Build and Customize

### Use the Visual or Code Editor

- You can choose between:
  - **Visual Builder** – tweak layout, connect wallet buttons, and add contract interactions
  - **Code Editor** – edit raw smart contracts and frontend files directly

### Smart Contract Development

- Get real-time syntax checking
- Preview ABI structure
- Add functions, events, and modifiers directly or with AI suggestions

### Local Testing

- Deploy to **testnets** 
- Get test tokens from integrated faucets
- Simulate interactions _(buy/sell/stake/mint)_ before going live

### AI Assistance

- Keringit’s AI reviews your smart contracts as you code
- Suggestions may include:
  - Fixing logic errors
  - Gas optimizations
  - Security best practices (e.g., reentrancy, overflow)

## 4. Deploy and Go Live

### Select Network

- Choose from supported chains: Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, BNB, Polygon, TON, etc.
- Add custom RPCs for private or test networks if needed

### Configure Deployment

- Set your parameters:
  - Contract name and version
  - Gas settings
  - Optional constructor arguments
  - Frontend environment variables

### Launch Project

- Hit **Deploy**
- Track build status in real-time: contract compile → verification → deployment
- Once deployed, get:
  - Public smart contract address
  - Frontend URL (hosted or exportable)
  - Auto-generated technical documentation

## 5. Monitor and Improve

### Analytics Dashboard

- View wallet usage, function calls, and tx volume
- Error logs help debug user issues
- See AI recommendations for performance and UX improvements

### Continuous Updates

- Push changes and redeploy directly
- Use Git-based version control if synced from GitHub
- Collaborate with team members using shared access
